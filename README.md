I'm the Software Lead of FIRST Robotics Team ERROR 3130, located in Woodbury Minnesota. Currently, am working on teaching and coding my robotics team's software using Java and the [WPILib](https://github.com/wpilibsuite) software library.

I studied computer science at the University of Minnesota for the past two years, learning Python, Java, C, and x86-64 Assembly.
